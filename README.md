# Grover-s-Sorting-Algorithm-
Griver-s algorith is an efficient algorithm for sorting, with big ohhh equals to sqaure-root of n, where n number of entities in the list that is bieng to be sorted.

It is a MATLAB code. I have written this for sorting of the numbers, that can be expressed in 3 bits. You can modify this code for higher number bits using same methdodlogy or using recursive function. There can be infinte long list of numbers in unsorted array(input).
